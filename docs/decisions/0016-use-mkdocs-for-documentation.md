## Context

We need a user-friendly, efficient, and maintainable documentation system.

## Decision

We have decided to use MkDocs for our documentation for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: MkDocs is easy to set up and use, allowing team members to contribute to documentation without extensive training.
2. **Markdown Support**: It uses Markdown for writing documentation, which is widely understood and allows for quick formatting.
3. **Theming and Customization**: MkDocs offers a variety of themes and customization options, enabling us to create a visually appealing documentation site that aligns with our branding.
4. **Version Control**: Documentation can be versioned alongside our codebase, ensuring that users always have access to the correct version of the documentation.
5. **Deployment**: MkDocs can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages or other hosting services, streamlining the process of making documentation publicly available.

## Consequences

Using MkDocs will make it easier to maintain and update our documentation, improving the onboarding process for new team members and enhancing the overall user experience.
