Date: 2024-10-17

## Status 

Accepted on 2024-10-17

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
We will document both smaller and larger decisions, but as we are experimenting, things will change over time.
