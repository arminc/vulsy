## Context

To maintain consistency and clarity in our code documentation we need a consistent style of documenting our code.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the Google style for Python docstrings. This style is widely recognized and provides a clear structure for documenting functions, classes, and modules.
Adopting this style will improve the readability of our code documentation and facilitate better understanding for new developers.
